# Binary to Gray Code Converter

A simple C program that converts binary numbers to their Gray code equivalent using recursion .
This implementation takes a binary number (as integer input) and converts it to its corresponding Gray code using bitwise operations and recursion .
Gray codes are used in digital communications for error detection and correction.

 Recursive conversion algorithm
 Handles positive integer inputs
 Simple and lightweight implementation.
